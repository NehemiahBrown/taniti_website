          <h2>Before You Travel</h2>
          <p>Before heading to Taniti Island, it’s helpful to prepare for the tropical climate. Families should pack lightweight clothing, swimsuits, sandals, and sun protection like hats and sunscreen. Don’t forget bug spray for rainforest excursions and any important medications. Passports are required, and it's a good idea to bring a small first-aid kit for kids. Taniti uses U.S. dollars, and most places accept credit cards, though cash is useful for markets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip2">
          <h2>Where to Stay</h2>
          <p>Taniti offers a wide range of lodging, making it easy for families to find the right fit. Choices include an affordable hostel, cozy bed and breakfasts, small family-run hotels, and one large, four-star resort. Families often stay in or near Taniti City or Merriton Landing for easy access to restaurants, beaches, and activities. All lodging is government-regulated and inspected regularly to ensure guest safety and comfort.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip3">
          <h2>How to Get Around</h2>
          <p>Getting around Taniti is simple and family-friendly. Public buses run through Taniti City from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily, and private buses connect other areas of the island. Taxis are available in the city, and rental bikes with helmets can be found throughout tourist areas. The island is flat and very walkable, especially in places like Merriton Landing, where many families choose to stay.</p>

        <div class="tip4">
          <h2>Island Safety Tips</h2>
          <p>Taniti is a safe destination with very little violent crime, though families should watch for minor issues like pickpocketing in busy areas. One hospital and several clinics serve the island, and many staff members speak multiple languages. Beaches don’t always have lifeguards, so parents should supervise children closely. Helmets are required by law for all bike rentals, and visitors should be aware that alcohol cannot be sold between <span class="alcohol">midnight and 9:00 a.m.<span></p>
